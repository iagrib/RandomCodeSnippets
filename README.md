# RandomCodeSnippets

This is a collection of code snippets written by me. They can be useful in some situations, feel free to grab them if you need them & modify at your will, leaving a credit if you're gonna use them in your project would be nice.

I do not guarantee that these pieces of code are 100% stable/optimized/working, suggestions are welcome (through pull requests).
