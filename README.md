# RandomCodeSnippets

This is a collection of code snippets written by me. They can be useful in some situations, feel free to grab & modify them at your will if you need. If you're gonna use them in your project, leaving a credit would be nice.

I can not guarantee that these pieces of code are 100% stable/optimized or that they work at all, suggestions are welcome (through pull requests).
